  <h2>What is Chainmaille?</h2>
  <p>Chainmaille, also known as maille, chain mail, chainmail, and mail, is the weaving of interconnected rings into a fabric like mesh or chain for use as an armour, jewelry, or decorative art and sculptures.</p>
  <p>These days we define &ldquo;mail&rdquo; as it was defined in the Middle Ages. It consists of a &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; of interlocked metal rings which form a strong, flexible, mesh armour.Â The word &ldquo;mail&rdquo; is derived through the Old English mayle, French maille, and Italian maglia, from the Latin macula meaning the mesh of a net. (Arador Armoury, 2013)</p>
  <p>Those of us that work in this craft/art, prefer the use of the French &quot;maille&quot; or &quot;chainmaille&quot;. This helps to differentiate what we do with those annoying letters promising bad luck if you fail to send it to so many people within so many days or hours.</p>
